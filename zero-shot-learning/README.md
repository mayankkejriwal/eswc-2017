Although I have been toying with the idea of zero shot type recommendations for a while now, I could not
do enough experiments to include in our eswc-2017 submission. We are aiming for the ISWJ 2017 special call
on knowledge graph construction. The experiments in this folder use much of the data that was either input to
or generated as intermediate/final outputs of our eswc 2017 experiments. Thus, I decided not to create
a separate outer folder or rep.
